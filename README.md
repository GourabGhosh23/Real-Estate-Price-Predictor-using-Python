# Real-Estate-Price-Predictor-using-Python

**Description:**  


The Real Estate Price Predictor project is designed to predict housing prices based on various features such as the number of rooms (RM), the proportion of residential land zoned for large lots (ZN), and the percentage of lower status of the population (LSTAT). The project utilizes machine learning techniques, specifically employing the Random Forest Regressor model, to analyze historical housing data and make accurate predictions on real estate prices.

The process involves comprehensive data exploration, including statistical analysis, visualization, and correlation studies, to gain insights into the relationships between different features and the target variable (MEDV). The dataset is split into training and testing sets, with the training set used to train the machine learning model.

A pipeline is constructed to handle data preprocessing tasks, such as imputing missing values and standardizing numerical features. The chosen machine learning model, the Random Forest Regressor, is trained on the prepared training data.

The model's performance is evaluated using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). Cross-validation is employed to ensure the robustness of the model by assessing its performance across multiple subsets of the training data.

Once the model is trained and evaluated, it is saved for future use. The final step involves testing the model on a separate test set to assess its predictive capabilities on unseen data. The results are then compared with the actual prices to measure the accuracy and effectiveness of the Real Estate Price Predictor.

This project serves as a valuable tool for real estate professionals, investors, and anyone interested in predicting housing prices based on key features. The machine learning model provides a data-driven approach to making informed decisions in the dynamic and complex real estate market.
